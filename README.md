code-frist-students-app
Description This is a simple C# console application that uses Entity Framework Code-First to create a database called StudentDB and add one student record to it. What is Code-First? Code-First means we create the database using C# classes instead of designing it first in SQL. Entity Framework automatically creates the database based on our code.

How It Works A Student class defines the data (Id, Name, EnrollmentDate, etc.). A StudentContext class connects to the database. When the app runs, it creates the database and adds one student automatically.# code-frist-students-app
